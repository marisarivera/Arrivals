    ">**COD Alpha**: Alpha Code for Country of Dispatch <br>\n",
    ">**COO Alpha**: Alpha code for Country of Origin, which is the country where the goods were originally produced, and it may be different from the Country of Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "*VARIABLES CUANTITATIVAS*\n",
    ">**Commodity Code**: 9 digit commodity code, where digits 1-8 are the Combined Nomenclature (CN) code and digit 9 is 0 (formerly national sub-division) <br>\n",
    ">**Record Type**: Range 0-3 identifies the kind of suppression record <br>\n",
    ">**COD Sequence**: Numeric sequence for Country of Dispatch <br>\n",
    ">**Trade Indicator**: A code used to identify the type of trade. Code is used in conjunction with Suite Indicator to select appropriate items for General and Special trade compilations. Indicators are: [5] - removal from warehouse into free circulation, [4] - import into warehouse (goods not in free circulation), [0] - all other items <br>\n",
    ">**COO Sequence**: Numeric sequence for Country of Origin <br>\n",
    ">**Nature of Transaction**: Codes used for EU (Intrastat) trade only, describing the type of transaction <br>\n",
    ">**Mode of Transport**: Mode of transport by which goods leave or arrive in the UK <br>\n",
    ">**Period Reference**: Identifies the month of account of an item in format 0YYYYMM. For non-amendment records this will be the same as the file month; for amendment records and late supplementary declarations it will be the month to which the amendment or supplementary declaration relates <br>\n",

    ">**IP Commodity Code**: A pseudo concessionary comcode beginning 98 used for declaration of high value Industrial Plant <br>\n",
    ">**Number of Consignments**: Optional field used to indicate the number of consignments <br>\n",
    ">**Stat Value**: Invoice or contract price of the goods (£ sterling) as used for statistical purposes. The import value is the value of the goods including the cost, insurance and freight <br>\n",
    ">**Net Mass**: Weight of the item in kilograms excluding packaging <br>\n",
    ">**Supp Unit**: Second quantity (e.g. number) required for certain commodities, as specified in the Tariff/ICN <br>\n",
    ">**File Month**: File Month <br>\n",
